# myadfilter
Contains my personal filter list for Adblock Plus.

Changes are made to [myadfilter-devel.txt](myadfilter-devel.txt) which contains no checksum.

[myadfilter.txt](myadfilter.txt) is created by python script [addChecksum.py](https://hg.adblockplus.org/adblockplus/file/tip/addChecksum.py) provided by Adblock Plus.

Checksum can be validated with [validateChecksum.py](https://hg.adblockplus.org/adblockplus/file/tip/validateChecksum.py).
